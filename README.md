# 2016 07 28 Make-over of Sardi as of version 7.1+

I skipped logging in detail since it would have taken me more time to log than to actually change things but here is what I did.

Made it obvious in the numbering that 6.2 and 7 version are completely different.


Changed the structure of the Sardi icons folders

From scalable 

to 

16 22 24 32 48 64 128 and scalable.

This will allow current and future problems to be solved.
Icons that do not 'behave' properly can get an other icon at the desired width.
This gives more flexibility to the end-user to pop in an icon they like.

Choose to go for white icons in the toolbar : network and sound icons 

Tried to minimize the MB by inheriting to one basic theme Sardi. A lot of work with only 5MB less out of 134 MB. 

Checked to see if I was missing icons that the Numix icon team had created in the mean time in the various subsets of Sardi.

During my testing I did not install Numix (used as inherit for Sardi) and checked that all icons were in Sardi in the various subsets.

Changed the numix icons I did not like. Mostly making some of the icons white instead of blue and green. Goal was an uniform white look for the symbolic icons.

Again the icon set was retested on the various operating systems.


# 2016 07 24 start-here-symbolic

All distro's have a way to change the icons where you actually start your menu or applications list.

There are 17+ icons to start your distro. 

In the folder places of the major subsets (sardi, sardi flat, sardi flexible, sardi ghost flexible and sardi mono) there are a number of start-here-symbolic icons. 

Rename the one you like to 'start-here-symbolic.svg' (without the number).

Delete the icon-theme.cache in the subset you have choosen e.g. sardi or you will see nothing.

Change the theme once more to see the effect.


Other distro's you can point to the picture that is shown in the menu. They do not need to change the name or delete the icon-theme.cache.

# What is Sardi

Sardi is based on Ardis Icon Theme from Kotus Works. You can say it is a fork but it has grown
beyond its origins.

(Sardi is an anagram for Ardis)


<b>It can be installed on a variety of distro's as you can see at the bottom of this page.</b>


As always we stand on the shoulders of others, who share the knowledge and the (hard) work.

Ardis Icon Theme is a project originally created by Kotus Works <kotus.works@gmail.com>

	"This project's goal is to create a truly open source icon theme,
	 to support every DE, and to theme as many applications as possible."

It is a personal learning project : 

	- how to make an icon theme in linux and
	- how to use inkscape to make the icons (512px)


# Documentation

Documentation to be found at http://erikdubois.be

Look for info in category Linux/Sardi.


http://erikdubois.be/category/linux/sardi-icons/



# Own creations

Starting of June 2015 I started developing some of the missing icons on distro's.

Each icon has to be created and five subsets of it.

	- Sardi
	- Sardi Flat
	- Sardi Flexible
	- Sardi Ghost Flexible
	- Sardi Mono

Each of these subsets will receive a new icon.



# Installation of Sardi

Get the very latest Sardi icons from Sourceforge.

https://sourceforge.net/projects/sardi/files/?source=directory

Extract this tar.gz file with fileroller, engrampa or any other application.

Make sure that you have an hidden folder .icons in your home folder by pressing CTRL + H.

If you do not have a .icons folder yet, make one.

Copy/paste the <b>whole</b> content of Sardi folder in the hidden folder .icons.

Select with the tool of your distro the icon set.

<b>Some of the icons do not change on your distro because your linux distribution is
hardcoding the path in the desktop file 

READ ON HOW TO SOLVE THAT.</b>


![Screenshots](http://i.imgur.com/5clxmdg.jpg)



# This theme inherits from ...

Some of the themes inherit from each other so install the <b>complete</b> content of the Sardi tar.gz file.

If any of the icons are missing this theme will use Numix and Numix Circle.

You should install it as a fall-back icon theme. It is a 'just in case' scenario. Follow the steps described here. It is such a nice icon theme you should have it anyway.


https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme-circle


In the end you will have 4 icon themes 

- numix
- numix-light
- numix-circle
- numix-circle-light






# HOW TO FIX HARDCODED ICONS



# Hardcode-fixer script


Some icons do not seem to change whatever theme of icons your are choosing. That is because the programmer is pointing the path of the "Icon" to one specific place.

	For example : Linux Mint Update used to be 
	/usr/lib/linuxmint/mintUpdate/icons/base.svg

Working together with Joshua Fogg is the best way to proceed to get all references to icons like they should be in the first place.

You can find his hardcode-fixer script at 

https://github.com/Foggalong/hardcode-fixer

Read what it does on his website.

The script will get the latest csv file from the net, so you need to have 'curl' installed. 

	sudo apt-get install curl

Run it with

	sudo ./fix.sh

You will get an output of all the icons/applications that have been fixed.

June 2015 I filed all the hardcoded links of Linux Mint to that website and now all hardcoded links should be gone, IF YOU RUN THE SCRIPT. 
If you do find an icon that will never change, file it yourself at https://github.com/Foggalong/hardcode-fixer.



### T I P 

If for some reason you want to revert back to the situation before you ran the hardcode-fixer you can do so.

	sudo ./fix.sh -r

# The latest developments are mentioned first.

# Sardi Dark Breeze

![Screenshots](http://i.imgur.com/0xba3Oy.jpg)


# Sardi Mono Grey

Based on Sardi Mono orange made this new monochrome look. All action icons have been grayscaled too.

The scripts I have used to change colours and to make the icons monochrome are included in the download for future developers.


![Screenshots](http://i.imgur.com/kPCBmsK.png)


# Sardi Flexible

Sardi Flexible is a monochrome icon theme where you get to choose the background color.
There will be always a white outercircle and a white icon.
Via two scripts you can change the color to your liking. You have 16.5 million color choices.

Starting colour

You can change all these white icons to the colour of your liking via a script.

![Screenshots](http://i.imgur.com/4BtprUq.jpg)

![Screenshots](http://i.imgur.com/bSJb1Io.jpg)


If you rather like all the white icons to be black (or any other colour), this can be partially achieved by these commands

	#folder actions
	find scalable/actions -name "*.svg" -type f -exec sed -i '/fill="#fffffe"/!s/fill="#'$oldcolour'"/fill="#'$newcolour'"/g' {}  \;
	find scalable/actions -name "*.svg" -type f -exec sed -i '/fill:#fffffe/!s/fill:#'$oldcolour'/fill:#'$newcolour'/g' {}  \;



# Sardi Flat 

Sardi Icons have no longer a circular white border and shadows. This flattens the icon set considerably.

![Screenshots](http://i.imgur.com/O0LV4Fi.jpg)




# Sardi Flat Black (has been replaced with Sardi Colora - script makes it black)

This icons set has black folders. Rest of the icons are inherited from Sardi Flat.
The following code was used to make the blue folders black in the map places.

	find -name "*.svg" -exec sed -i 's/6997c7/494949/g' {}  \;


![Screenshots](http://i.imgur.com/pEfijYj.jpg)




# Sardi Vertexed


In my learning process I wanted to know if I could only change the folders. As I like the vertex icon theme from horst3180 at https://github.com/horst3180/Vertex-Icons, I tried to mix the two together.

I combined both Ardis and Vertex to come to Sardi Vertexed.

You need to have Sardi installed as Sardi Vertexed only has information about places like folders. Rest of the icons are inherited from Sardi.

![Screenshots](http://i.imgur.com/2RROxfh.jpg)




# Sardi Faenza Black (has been discontinued)


The black folders from http://www.deviantart.com/art/Faenza-Black-244042717 were added to the icon theme.
The icons will be from Sardi but all folders will be from Faenza Black.

You need to have Sardi installed as Sardi Faenza Black only has information about places like folders. Rest of the icons are inherited from Sardi.

This will result in this.

![Screenshots](http://i.imgur.com/zufL9ww.jpg)




# Sardi Mono


Based on the screenshots of users on Google + I wondered if it was possible to have monochrome icons based on the Sardi Icon theme.

I can only say it pays of to learn CLI. 

This line did all the work while I watched a series on television (3-4 hours)

	find -name "*.svg" -exec inkscape -f {} --verb=org.inkscape.color.grayscale --verb=FileSave --verb=FileClose \;

All icons have been 'grayscaled' in colour. 




![Screenshots](http://i.imgur.com/GbpjBW1.png)




![Screenshots](http://i.imgur.com/OwOBsox.jpg)



# Sardi Orange (has been replaced with Sardi Colora - script makes it orange)


If you do not like the blue folders you can always change the colour via CLI.

I applied this code on all the icons in the places directory (blue folders) and 1 second later they were all in orange.

	find -name "*.svg" -exec sed -i 's/6997c7/f38725/g' {}  \;

The first colour is blue (6997c7) and the replacement is orange(f38725).

I think this link is one you should bookmark http://sed.sourceforge.net/sed1line.txt.

Open the .svg with sublime-text for example and look for the colour codes. I took two .svg's. One was blue and was orange. That was the only difference. I quickly discovered which code was different and changed it with the script.

Underneath you will find an example of a screenshot of red folders using this method.

You need to have Sardi installed as Sardi Orange only has information about places like folders. Rest of the icons are inherited from Sardi.

![Screenshots](http://i.imgur.com/DSdfThM.jpg)

Extra colour codes starting with the Sardi/scalable/extra/places/blue folder

Grey
	find -name "*.svg" -exec sed -i 's/6997c7/cccccc/g' {}  \;




# Sardi Grey (has been replaced with Sardi Colora - script makes it grey)


Sardi Grey has been made in the exact same manner as Sardi Orange. Read Sardi Orange.

![Screenshots](http://i.imgur.com/mUrBj4g.pngf)



# Sardi Red (has been replaced with Sardi Colora - script makes it red)

Sardi Red has been made in the exact same manner as Sardi Orange. Read Sardi Orange.


	find -name "*.svg" -exec sed -i 's/6997c7/aa1111/g' {}  \;

# Request Icons & Issues with current icons


When reporting missing or wrong looking icons make sure to follow these steps so I can resolve it faster and efficiently:

## Screenfetch

Install screenfetch to give me information of your distro and Desktop Environment.

	sudo apt install screenfetch

Copy/paste the code you will receive or provide manually on what distro and desktop environment you are on and what version.

## Icon name 

Add the relevant launcher information, applications use files with the extension .desktop as launchers like Firefox, Mint menu, etc. and these launchers are stored in 

	/usr/share/applications (there might be a /kde or /kde4 folder for KDE apps)


User-installed binaries and Google Chrome apps install their launchers here: 

	/home/$USER/.local/share/applications

Simply open these .desktop files with any text editor or sublime-text and copy and paste the line that says 

	Icon=...

to your issue or request.

## General info

Add a description of the software and a link where to download it and/or installation instructions if necessary.


## Original icon

Sometimes the application will already have an icon. Provide the link where the original icon can be found.
I prefer them to be in SVG. A png is a last resort.



## Screenshots

Add screenshots of the missing icon and the instances where it's displayed like: menus, taskbars, panels, notifications, etc.



REMARK : Some applications use absolute paths in their launchers, as such even when we add the icon the system will not load it, you can use Hardcoded Icon Fixer to resolve this problem as explained above.


# Credits

I love the numix circle theme. On any distribution it looks really nice.
I am using some of their icons if ever I am in need of it and I am actively
contributing to their theme by mentioning missing icons and other stuff on
their github.
If ever you decide to contribute too, post issues at this address.

Ardis Icon Theme is a project originally created by Kotus Works <kotus.works@gmail.com>

This project's goal is to create a truly open source icon theme, to support every DE, and to theme as many applications as possible.

Ardis Icon Theme's inspiration is drawn from a combination of styles including

- Numix utouchicon theme: https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme-utouch
- Simple icon theme: http://kxmylo.deviantart.com/art/Simple-icon-theme-426040287
- Flamini icon pack: http://kotusworks.deviantart.com/art/Flamini-icons-set-for-KDE-437738820
        
Every icon in this icon pack is in .svg format with size of 512x512 px.


On 26th May of 2015 Kotus Works has expressed on google + the following : 

	Unfortunately I have no more time to work on all of my icons
	projects do to some recent personal stuff that are going on.
	So I'm actually forced to retire from icon making.
